## Introduction

The Work Day Scheduler is a web-based application designed to help you plan and manage your work day effectively. It allows you to schedule events for each hour of a typical working day, from 9 AM to 5 PM. With color-coded time blocks, you can easily identify past, present, and future events. The scheduler also saves your events locally, ensuring they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features
